Hello, Everyone!!
My names Juan Carlos. I am a motivated software engineer who enjoys learning new things!!! I enjoy taking that new knowledge and leveraging it to create new fun things. Right now I'm looking for my first position as a softeware engineer. I'm excited to bring my knowledge of JavaScript and my eye for visual design to a project and create amazing user experiences.
